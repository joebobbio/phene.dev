<h1>PHENE.DEV PRIVACY POLICY</h1>

<h3>Thank you for taking an interest in your digital privacy!</h3>

<p>Big long legal documents are boring, so I&#39;m going to make this as simple as possible.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s what&#39;s automatically collected when you visit this website:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Your IP address</li>
	<li>Information about your device, such as
	<ul>
		<li>Your screen size and resolution</li>
		<li>Your operating system (OS)</li>
		<li>What browser you are using</li>
		<li>Your device form factor (laptop, tablet, mobile phone, etc)</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>What pages you request</li>
</ul>

<p>Sometimes there may be links to third-party websites on my website. Third-party websites are governed by their own Privacy Policies, and I encourage you to read them.</p>

<p>Sometimes you may provide me additional private information (email address, name, etc) when contacting me or requesting to open a Webmail account. I *never* sell or share your data.</p>

<p>This website uses Google Analytics to help me better understand site traffic and engagement. Should you wish to opt-out of Google Analytics tracking, you may do so by installing <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fllaojicojecljbmefodhfapmkghcbnh">this extension</a> or however you normally block this sort of thing.</p>
