<h1>PHENE.DEV PRIVACY POLICY</h1>

<h3>Thank you for taking an interest in your digital privacy!</h3>

<p>Big long legal documents are boring, so I&#39;m going to make this as simple as possible.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s what&#39;s automatically collected when you visit this website:</p>

<ul>

	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>What pages you request</li>
</ul>

<p>Sometimes there may be links to third-party websites on my website. Third-party websites are governed by their own Privacy Policies, and I encourage you to read them.</p>
